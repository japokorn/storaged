There is an unspecified issue in *_update function in src/udiskslinuxloop.c


Running run30 script in project root directory will reiterate failing tests and recreate the issue (cca 2-6 times out of 30).
There will be also created out<iteration#>.log files for each run of the tests which carry additional log messages from the udisks daemon.

The issue itself is created by switched up names of temporary backing files created by functions test_loop_rw (failing one) and test_loop_ro.
Comparison of the log files with backing file names have not resulted in any addtional information.
Using both original and libblockdev approaches together showed occasional difference in functions results nevetherless unrelevant to the issue occurence.
Adding sleep(5) to the beginning of each of these functions lowered freqency of error (to cca 1 out of 160).
